# Hydroknecht


General Stuff


Hydroknecht is a smart modular 3d printed Hydroponicsystem which is also open source. Feel free to modify it for your preferences and components. It is realy
customizeable. It has a smart version and a commen version. The smart version has some handy features like controlling the system whith a web interface. It has a PH
-sensor, temperature sensor and a light sensor. The Waterpump is also controlled over your web interface for regular switching on of the pump. The common version is
without electronics (apart from the water pump). But first of all we should look at our system andhow it works. So Hydroknecht is a vertical rain tower hydroponicsystem which is good
for fast growing of plants. The water is in a reservoir at the bottom of the towerand get pumped with the water pump to the top and it rains down which
give the plants water. In the water are nutrients and minerals for the plants because the plantsdont get minerals through the soil. The plants are in netcups which a
refilled with rockwool or coconut coir which is a good substrate. The rain drops on the roots togive them Water. This planting system is more bio because you dont needpesticides and 
you can use bio nutrients so your food is 100% Bio. It has diffrent module but wetalk first about the standard module. So the standard module ist a main module for 3 plants. It also 
has a module for 5 plants but later more to that. So the standard module has 2 version these are pretty much the same but with a few
differences. You stack them staggered so alway the first module and then the second and onand on. The angled parts are glue on the standard module. They hold the net
cups in place. The shower module isthe module which let the water rain down. It hold the water spreader. This module got stacked beetween the standard module and the top module. The
Top module is the topthat no water splashes out. For the smart version is the top part more important becaus it holds the electronics but an extended 
explanation below. The Water spreader isthe part which spreads the water in all directions. This part must maybe get a little modified if you need more water pressure
with which it splashes out. You must modify that the tube is closer to the upper part of the water spreader you need to move the surfaces (See Picture). The Water
reservoir is a bit more different to printbecaus it must be water safe. Heres a Blog post from Prusaprinter which explain how you get water safe results. [Blog Post](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/watertight-3d-printing-pt1-vases-cups-and-other-open-models_48949/)
The advanced module is for more space efficiency because you have now on your standard module place for 5 plants so you get the max out of your module. You have two
different types of feets for the tower. One which is more sleeker and more a look upgrade. The second stand foot gives more hold for larger towers. For two feets it also
have versions with a cable channel. And finaly the last module the Netcup. It holds the plant and the substrate in place and also lets the roots grow out freely.


Differences between smart and common version


So the smart version is obviously smart and has some handy features. The smart version works with a ESP 8266. The smart version also controls the pump. It activates it at fixed time 
intervals. For the common version I would recommend a time socket or a smart socket with a app to control the pump. The difference in the 3d model is that the smart version has 
aditional cable duct inside to pass the cables through the tower. The electric brain from the smart version is in the top part. But more to that in the Electronic part.
