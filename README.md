<h3> General Stuff </h3>


Hydroknecht is a smart modular 3d printed Hydroponicsystem which is also open source. Feel free to modify it for your preferences and components. It is realy
customizeable. It has a smart version and a commen version. The smart version has some handy features like controlling the system with a web interface. 
It has a PH-sensor, temperature sensor and a light sensor. The Waterpump is also controlled over your web interface for regular switching on of the pump. The common 
version is without electronics (apart from the water pump). But first of all we should look at our system and how it works. So Hydroknecht is a vertical rain tower 
hydroponicsystem which is good for fast growing of plants.

The water is in a reservoir at the bottom of the tower and get pumped with the water pump to the top and it rains down which
give the plants water. In the water are nutrients and minerals for the plants because the plants dont get minerals through the soil. The plants are in netcups which are filled with 
rockwool or coconut coir which is a good substrate. The rain drops on the roots togive them Water. This planting system is more bio because you dont need pesticides and 
you can use bio nutrients so your food is 100% Bio. 


<h3> Modules </h3>


It has diffrent modules but we talk first about the standard module. So the standard module ist a main module for 3 plants. It also 
has a module for 5 plants but later more to that. So the standard module has 2 version these are pretty much the same but with a few differences.

You stack them staggered so alway the first module and then the second and onand on. The angled parts are glue on the standard module. They hold the netcups in place.

The shower module is the module which let the water rain down. It hold the water spreader. This module got stacked beetween the standard module and the top module. The
Top module is the top that no water splashes out. For the smart version is the top part more important 
it holds the electronics but an extended explanation below.

The Water spreader is the part which spreads the water in all directions.This part must maybe get a little modified if you need more water pressure
with which it splashes out. You must modify that the tube is closer to the upper part of the water spreader you need to move the surfaces (See Picture).

The Water reservoir is a bit more different to print because it must be water safe. More to that later. 
The advanced module is for more space efficiency because you have now on your standard module place for 5 plants so you get the max out of your module.

You have two different types of feets for the tower. One which is more sleeker and more a look upgrade. The second stand foot gives more hold for larger towers. For two feets it also
have versions with a cable channel. It also has a cover cap that no water drops out of the reservoir. This model works for all versions. And finaly the last module the Netcup. It 
holds the plant and the substrate in place and also lets the roots grow out freely.


<h3> Differences between smart and common version </h3>


So the smart version is obviously smart and has some handy features. The smart version works with a ESP 8266. The smart version also controls the pump and activates it at fixed time 
intervals. For the common version I would recommend a time socket or a smart socket with a app to control the pump. The difference in the 3d model is that the smart version has 
aditional cable duct inside to pass the cables through the tower. The electric brain from the smart version is in the top part. But more to that in the Electronic part.


<h3> The reservoir </h3>


So the reservoir is a little bit tricky. You must get it water safe that it not leak. You can also use a bucket which helps to safe time and filament but you dont get the overall 
iconic look for the Hydroponicsystem, also the stability is bad with huge towers so we decided to print it. You need to achange a few things in prusa slicer. Prusa did a great Blog 
post about this theme. Here is  a link to it . [Blog Post](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/watertight-3d-printing-pt1-vases-cups-and-other-open-models_48949/)
Also a great way to get water safe results is epoxy resin. It is a bit anoying to handle but it works good for make your reservoir water safe. The best options to smooth it with 
chemicals like acetone. More Information about Water safe 3d prints are in the helpful blo post from prusaprinters.
